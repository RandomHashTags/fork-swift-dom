# ``DOM``

This module defines the basic infrastructure common to all DOM encoding interfaces.

**You should not import this module directly**; it is not very useful on its own, and this is by design. Instead, you should import ``HTML`` or ``Sitemaps``, which re-export this module, and add useful APIs to its types through extensions.
